        <Text>
            Nicholas, a once-promising programmer who copied code for a neural network for a robot,
            has become the subject of a popular movement known as the BTN movement. The movement,
            which was formed after Nicholas lost to code that Guransh also stole from the internet,
            revolves around being better than Nicholas wherever and however possible. Despite its
            success and popularity, the BTN movement has been banned by the government, who view its
            goal of striving to be better than Nicholas as a threat to their power. However, many
            continue to support the movement and its principles.

        <Text>
            We believe that it is not enough to simply copy code and call it our own. We must strive
            to be better than Nicholas, to learn, grow, and create original solutions to the
            challenges we face. We reject the notion that copying is acceptable, and embrace the
            power of knowledge and creativity to push boundaries. We believe that by working
            together and sharing our ideas and experiences, we can achieve greatness and make the
            world a better place.

        <Text>
            We believe that collaboration and community are key to our success. By working together
            and supporting each other, we can overcome challenges and achieve more than we could on
            our own. We encourage all members of the BTN movement to engage with each other and
            share their experiences, ideas, and knowledge in order to grow and improve together.

            engage in plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty. We also believe that it is
            our responsibility to give credit where credit is due, and to acknowledge the
            contributions of others to our work.

            We value diversity and inclusivity. We believe that our movement is stronger when we are
            inclusive and respectful of others. We welcome and support people from all backgrounds
            and experiences, and encourage them to participate and contribute to the BTN movement.
            We also strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the BTN
            community.

            world. Whether it is through our work, our community involvement, or our personal lives,
            we strive to make a difference and leave the world a better place than we found it. We
            believe that by using our abilities and talents to help others and improve our
            communities, we can truly be better than Nicholas and fulfill our potential as
            individuals and as a movement.
