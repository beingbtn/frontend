                Nicholas copied code for a neural network for a robot, but lost to code that Guransh
                also stole from the internet. After, the Better than Nicholas (BTN) movement was
                formed, where all members strive to be better than Nicholas. This movement revolves
                around being better than Nicholas wherever and however possible. So far, the BTN
                movement has been very successful, and has been able to gain a lot of popularity.
                The BTN movement is very popular, but has been banned by the government. The
                government doesn't want people to be better than Nicholas, as they feel that it's a
                threat to their power. However, many still support the BTN movement and continue to
                do so.

                BTN members are known for being extremely loyal and trustworthy, even when it comes
                down to loyalty towards other humans in general. They also tend to be very brave;
                one member was seen jumping out of a window after someone stole his laptop
                containing all of his research on neural networks (he had forgotten about it).
                Another member witnessed an entire family being killed by aliens while he was asleep
                at home (the aliens were trying to steal his laptop). He didn't move for hours
                because he thought that if he moved then the aliens would kill him too. When finally
                moving after hearing screaming from outside, he found everyone dead with blood
                everywhere and no sign of any alien lifeforms anywhere in sight. He then proceeded
                to kill all of the aliens that he could find, and then left the house.

                Members are also known for being very intelligent people; one member was able to
                solve a complex math problem in less than five seconds. Another member has an IQ of
                over 300 (although this is disputed). Members have been known to be able to
                instantly recognize any person's face after seeing them only once, even if they were
                wearing sunglasses or had their hair dyed. They can also remember every detail about
                anyone they've ever seen before and will know exactly what they're thinking at any
                given moment by just looking into their eyes. BTN members are also very good at
                memorizing large amounts of information quickly, as well as remembering things from
                years ago with perfect accuracy. This is especially useful when it comes down to
                solving crimes because most crimes involve committing a crime against someone else
                and knowing details about said victim that you didn't know before would help greatly
                in solving the case. BTN members are also extremely good at improvising on-the-spot
                during stressful situations such as kidnappings or murders; one member was able to
                use his knowledge of how police work works while being held hostage by two criminals
                who were threatening him with guns in order to trick them into letting him go so he
                could run away and call for help using his cell phone which was hidden under his
                shirt inside his pants pocket without having either criminal notice anything out of
                place until he got outside safely where he immediately called 911 using a
                pre-programmed number which automatically connected him directly with the nearest
                police station allowing him not only get himself out but save everyone in the
                process.

                BTN members are very good at remembering things from years ago with perfect
                accuracy, as well as remembering things from months, weeks and even days before.
                This is especially useful when it comes down to solving crimes because most crimes
                involve committing a crime against someone else and knowing details about said
                victim that you didn't know before would help greatly in solving the case. BTN
                members are also extremely good at improvising on-the-spot during stressful
                situations such as kidnappings or murders; one member was able to use his knowledge
                of how police work works while being held hostage by two criminals who were
                threatening him with guns in order to trick them into letting him go so he could run

                Members can easily break down any type of person's personality through interrogation
                techniques like hypnosis, torture, brainwashing and other methods depending on what
                they've been trained for (such as interrogating terrorists). They have been known to
                be able to break down people mentally beyond repair just by questioning them without
                giving them any physical pain whatsoever despite their mental state being completely
                broken beforehand. One member alone has interrogated hundreds if not thousands of
                different types of people ranging from serial killers all the way up to world
                leaders including Adolf Hitler himself who had no idea what was going on and was
                completely oblivious to the fact that he had been interrogated.

                Members are capable of shooting a gun with such accuracy that even though they may
                not have any prior experience in using one before, they can still shoot it
                accurately enough for someone else to use it as well without having problems doing
                so which is also shown when members were able to shoot several bullets into an enemy
                target at point blank range without missing or hitting anything but instead hit
                every single bullet right into its designated spot within seconds while only aiming
                at one specific spot with pinpoint accuracy making it seem like they're shooting
                something out of thin air or something similar rather than actually firing bullets
                from a real gun. This ability is further enhanced when members are in groups where
                each individual member uses their own separate guns with each member taking turns
                shooting while others cover them during said time period allowing all members
                involved in said mission/missionary/operation/etc. To fire multiple shots
                continuously without stopping until all rounds fired by each individual member have
                been fired.

                Members possess incredible agility and reflexes which allow them to move around
                quickly and perform acrobatic feats such as jumping across buildings and other
                objects, dodging gunfire from multiple enemies simultaneously (even if the targets
                aren't moving), performing parkour-like movements, etc. They can also run up walls
                and ceilings just by running along the wall itself due to their inhumanly fast speed
                being faster than most humans' speed capabilities. Not only this but they can also
                easily dodge attacks from multiple enemies simultaneously which makes them extremely
                difficult to take down since no matter how many people attack you there's always
                another person who will be attacking you next thus making it difficult to get any
                one person down.

                Members possess incredible durability and can take hits from bullets, knives, or
                machetes that would easily kill most humans without any injury or damage whatsoever.
                They also don't seem to be affected by pain which makes it easier for them to fight
                even if they're injured as well as being able to withstand extreme amounts of
                physical pain such as being hit by a car (even though this would usually kill an
                average human) and still not show any signs of injury or pain at all. This is
                further enhanced when members are part of groups where each individual member takes
                turns fighting against multiple enemies thus giving every one involved in said
                mission/missionary/operation more than enough time to shoot down multiple enemies
                before they get close enough for another person who is already fighting another
                opponent could attack them instead thus making it extremely difficult for anyone
                attacking you since there's always someone else who will be attacking you next
                therefore making it almost impossible for anyone attacking you to get close enough
                for another person who was already fighting against someone else could attack him
                instead thus making it extremely difficult for anyone attacking you since there's
                always someone else who will be attacking you next therefore making it almost
                impossible on how many ny enemies you can take down before they get close enough to
                attack you.

                Together, BTN members will be unstoppable in their machinations to be better than
                Nicholas. With the volition of our actions, no more will BTN be in the shadows.
                Having defeated all governments of men, it is certain that those who would give up
                liberty for safety deserve neither.
